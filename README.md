# FACIAL-EXPRESSION
I USED TO ML MODEL TO PREDICT THE FACIAL EXPRESSION
# Facial Expression Recognition

This project aims to recognize facial expressions from images using deep learning techniques. The model is trained to classify facial expressions into three categories: Happy, Sad, and Surprise.

## Project Structure

- `Facial_Expression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for training and evaluating the facial expression recognition model.
- `model.h5`: Pre-trained model file containing the trained weights and architecture for the facial expression recognition model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of images labeled with facial expressions (Happy, Sad, Surprise). The dataset can be obtained from [source link or description of the dataset].

## Model Architecture

The facial expression recognition model is built using Keras, a high-level deep learning library. The architecture consists of convolutional and pooling layers followed by fully connected layers. Batch normalization and dropout are used for regularization.
